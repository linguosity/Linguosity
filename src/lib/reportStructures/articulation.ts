2. Strengths: Highlight what the student can do in terms of articulation.
3. Skills in development: Include standardized test data and note areas that are still developing, based on age norms.
4. Academic impact: Explain how the student's articulation skills impact access to curriculum, peer/adult relationships, and self-esteem.
5. Conclude with an impact statement about their eligibility for services, referencing relevant California Education Code if applicable."`;
